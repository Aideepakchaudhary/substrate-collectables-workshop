# Welcome to ETH Denver Substrate Collectables Workshop!

This was created for the Substrate Workshop at ETH Denver 2022 and is based on Substrate's [Kitties tutorial](https://docs.substrate.io/tutorials/v3/kitties/pt1/).

In this workshop, you'll learn how to build a standalone blockchain with Substrate that creates and manages the ownership of NFT-like assets and allows you to interact with them.

We have a lot to cover.
So let's get right to it!

To follow along for this workshop, you'll either need:

- To have your local environment set up with Rust and a compiled version of the Node Template
- OR a Github account to use the [Substrate Playground](https://playground.substrate.dev/?deploy=node-template)

**Acknowledgements:** thank you to Shawn for the original tutorial, inspired by the [crypto zombies tutorial](https://cryptozombies.io/en/lesson/1/chapter/1).

What you'll learn:

* The basic patterns for building and running a Substrate node on your local machine
* How to write a custom FRAME pallet and integrate it to your runtime
* How to create and query storage items for your chain and write callable functions that emit events and errors
