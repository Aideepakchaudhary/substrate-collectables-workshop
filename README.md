## Welcome to the Collectables Workshop! 

This workshop was created for ETH Denver 2022 and is based on the [Kitties tutorial](https://docs.substrate.io/tutorials/v3/kitties/pt1/). 

We have a lot to cover. 
So let's get right to it!

What you'll learn:

* the basic patterns for building and running a Substrate node.
* how to write a custom FRAME pallet and integrate it to your runtime.
* how to create and query storage items for your chain and write callable functions that emit events and errors

This workshop doesn't cover creating a custom front-end application for the chain, however you can follow [this tutorial](https://docs.substrate.io/tutorials/v3/kitties/pt2/) to learn how to do that.
