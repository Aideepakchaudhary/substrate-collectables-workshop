We'll be going through the "Build the Substrate Kitties Chain" tutorial which you can find [here](https://docs.substrate.io/tutorials/v3/kitties/pt1/). 

For this workshop, we've sort of shortened things to keep things within our time slot. 
The truth is, we have a lot to cover. 
So let's get right to it!

You'll learn:

* the basic patterns for building and running a Substrate node.
* how to write a custom FRAME pallet and integrate it to your runtime.
* how to create and query storage items for your chain and write callable functions that emit events and errors

This workshop doesn't cover creating a custom front-end application for the chain, however you can follow [this tutorial](https://docs.substrate.io/tutorials/v3/kitties/pt2/) to learn how to do that.
